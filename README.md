# odin-calculator

In this final project of the Odin Project Fundamentals, I will make use of all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've learned along the way and create a webpage containing an interactive calculator. Already I can predict that I'll need to use CSS grid again like with the etch-a-sketch project in order to create the keys. Additionally, I'll likely do research on hover events to show that the cursor is above a given key. The hardest part of the project looks like it will be on how to have the calculator not evaluate more than 1 pair of numbers at a time. This is my final project before I start to learn about the back-end side of webdev, so I hope to make the most in this final, solely front-end project.
