Keyboard Controls (key on left, correponding HTML button on right in parentheses)

* Equal (=)

In this final project of the Odin Project Fundamentals, I will make use of all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript I've learned along the way and create a webpage containing an interactive calculator. Already I can predict that I'll need to use CSS grid again like with the etch-a-sketch project in order to create the keys. Additionally, I'll likely do research on hover events to show that the cursor is above a given key. The hardest part of the project looks like it will be on how to have the calculator not evaluate more than 1 pair of numbers at a time. This is my final project before I start to learn about the back-end side of webdev, so I hope to make the most in this final, solely front-end project.

As a final project to the fundamentals to this program, this definitely felt like a test of everything that came before. HTML classes came in real handy in order to style elements via CSS and manipulate theme through JS. I got to see even more of the capabilities of CSS Grid such as changing the row and column position of a specific item as well as the size it takes up. As for JavaScript, this was the first time I've given functionality to the keybaord, in this case allowing the user to input into the calculator using the keys. From this point, I'll start to learn about the back end and more complexities about the front end. Lastly, I've added the keyboard controls to the top of this document for reference.
